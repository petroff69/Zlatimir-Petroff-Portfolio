       I'm really good at using frameworks like React, Node.js, and Three.js. 
       I learn things quickly and I like to work closely with clients. 
       I help to make solutions that are easy to use, can be made bigger or smaller, and solve real problems. 
I'm really good at JavaScript and I'm also making VR apps using Unity. At the same time, I'm learning C#. 
Even though I mostly do web development, I want to get better and combine VR development with science and math. 
I'm excited to work with you to make your ideas come true! Let's work together!`,
